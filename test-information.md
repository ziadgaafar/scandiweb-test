  - We expect to have no procedural outs ide of the initial application bootstrap, which could be registering routes/graphQL handlers, initiating database or router, and initiating config
  - We expect a demonstration of meaningful usage of OOP features, like inheritance, polymorphism provision, and clear delegation of responsibilities to each class
  - We expect code to be PSR compliant ([https://www.php-fig.org](https://www.php-fig.org/)) with following standards:
    - PSR-1
    - PSR-12

- Utilize models for categories and products and attributes
  - Each model should leverage polymorphism. We expect an abstract class for each model which has different types, with differences between types handled in their own sub-classes
  - Any differences handled in different types for Products and Attributes shall not require the usage of switches/if statements but handled in their own classes

  - We expect to see attributes as part of Product Schema however they should be implemented as a type of their own and resolved through their own set of classes and not directly on the Product Schema/Resolver
- You need to create a GraphQL mutation for inserting orders
